## Welcome!🎡

I am a CS Ph.D student from [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/), working with Prof. [Philippos Mordohai](https://mordohai.github.io/). I got my Master's degree from Stevens as well, working on Information and Data Engineering Program. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Renmin University of China. I am currently looking for Posdoc position and faculty job, here is my [Research Statement](files/Research_Statement_LC.pdf) and [CV](files/LC_CV.pdf).
